# A model orrery, displaying the sun and the planets rotating around it

This project is incomplete. When finished, there will be a slider to adjust the scale and one to adjust the speed at which time passes in the model. 

All planets will be feature their correct sizes, distances from each other, rotational period, and orbital period, as well as the eccentricity of their orbits.

The sun is far smaller and closer to the planets than it is in real life so that I can fit everything onto one window.
This presents an issue because Jupiter is now larger than the sun.

I did this project to increase my skill with web apps and JS. I opted to use pure JavaScript for everything, because I want to get good with plain JS before focusing on add-ons. 

If you want to see how it looks for real, simply clone the repo then open the html file locally in a browser. I like using chrome on full screen mode since you don't get the search bar and can use the entire screen to see the orrery.

To change the time or scale, edit the unit or time variables in the solar_system.js.
