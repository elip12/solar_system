# A model orrery, displaying the sun and the planets rotating around it

All planets will feature their correct sizes, distances from each other, rotational period, and orbital period.

The sun is far smaller and closer to the planets than it is in real life so that I can fit everything into one window.
This presents an issue because Jupiter is now larger than the sun.

I did this project to increase my skill with web apps and JS. I opted to use pure JavaScript for everything, because I want to get good with plain JS before focusing on add-ons. 

If you want to see how it looks for real, simply clone the repo then open the html file locally in a browser. I like using chrome on full screen mode since you don't get the search bar and can use the entire screen to see the orrery.

To change the time or scale, adjust the respective sliders.
